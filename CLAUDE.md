# LOCAL — Project Context for Claude Code

This file is auto-loaded by Claude Code at the start of every session in this
repo. It exists so a new session has the same context as our full build
history, without needing it re-explained.

## What this project is

**LOCAL** is a premium marketplace connecting customers with independent
local (Egyptian) brands — fashion, beauty, accessories, home. Think
Zalando/Farfetch-style browsing, but every brand is small and curated.

Two visual "modes" coexist intentionally:
- **Main site** (homepage, `/shop/[category]`, `/product/[id]`, `/cart`, etc.)
  — cream/black/beige palette, `Header.tsx` with the Brands mega menu.
- **Brand pages** (`/brands`, `/brands/[slug]`) — a separate navy/red/white
  editorial palette (see `tailwind.config.ts`: `navy`, `accentred`,
  `charcoal`, `muted`, `hairline` vs. the main site's `ink`, `cream`,
  `beige`, `stone`). **Do not merge these palettes** — this was a deliberate
  choice from two different design briefs, not an inconsistency to fix.
  `Header.tsx`/`Footer.tsx` (main site) ARE reused on brand pages though —
  only the content palette below the header differs.

## Tech stack

Next.js 16 (App Router) · TypeScript (strict) · Tailwind CSS ·
Framer Motion · Lucide icons · Supabase (Postgres + Auth, live).

## Architecture — read this before adding data or content

- **`content/`** — STATIC editorial/marketing copy that ships with the
  code (category hero text, mega menu items, journal articles). Edit code,
  redeploy.
- **`lib/data/`** — DYNAMIC data layer, reads live from Supabase
  (`products.ts`, `brands.ts`). Edit Supabase, no redeploy needed.
  These two folders look similar on purpose — the split is intentional,
  don't consolidate them.
- **`types/index.ts`** — every shared TypeScript type lives here in one
  file (including `CartLineItem`/`WishlistItem`, which are re-exported
  from their context files for convenience). Don't redefine types locally
  in components.
- **`components/shared/`** — cross-cutting UI (`StarRating.tsx`). If you
  find yourself duplicating price formatting or star rendering again,
  it belongs here or in `lib/format.ts`, not inline.
- **`context/`** — `CartContext` and `WishlistContext`, both persist to
  `localStorage` (not yet tied to a user account — see Roadmap).

## Supabase

- Schema: `supabase/schema.sql` — run once in the Supabase SQL editor.
  Covers `products`, `brands`, `orders`, `order_items`, `profiles`, with
  RLS enabled. **No public INSERT policies exist on purpose** — writes go
  through the service_role key server-side only, never the browser anon key.
- Seed script: `scripts/seed.mjs` — run locally with
  `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` env vars to populate the
  starter catalog. Never commit the service_role key anywhere.
- Client: `lib/supabase/client.ts` uses only the public anon key
  (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`), safe for
  both server and client components.
- `.env.local` is gitignored and NOT included when this project is shared
  as a zip — copy `.env.local.example` and fill in real values locally,
  and set the same two `NEXT_PUBLIC_` vars in Vercel → Settings →
  Environment Variables.
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_NOTIFICATIONS`/`_AUDIT_LOG`/`_ERRORS` (optional) —
  per-channel Discord webhook URLs for the log-mirroring system above.
  Server-only, never `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. Leave unset locally and everything
  still works — `sendToDiscord()` just no-ops for whichever channel has
  no URL configured.

## Security notes already handled

- Search (`lib/data/products.ts` → `searchProducts`) uses parameterized
  `.ilike()` calls, not string-interpolated `.or()` filters — this was a
  real filter-injection vector that got fixed, don't revert to the
  interpolated pattern.
- `app/error.tsx` + `app/global-error.tsx` exist as error boundaries.
  The data-layer functions in `lib/data/` deliberately `throw` on real
  Supabase errors (so the boundary catches them) but return `null`/`[]`
  for legitimate "not found" or "empty" states — keep that distinction
  when adding new data functions.
- Watch for React's `react/no-unescaped-entities` ESLint rule — plain
  apostrophes (`'`) in JSX text (e.g. "couldn't", "you're") fail
  production builds. Use `&apos;` in JSX text nodes.
- `PATCH /api/admin/users/[id]` has exactly one branch (`body.access`),
  gated by `requireStaffRole("admin")`. Two older branches
  (`body.isAdmin` boolean, bare `body.role` string) were removed after a
  security audit found the `isAdmin` one was only gated by
  `requireAdminUser()` — which accepts *any* rank, including "staff" — so
  a staff-rank account could grant or revoke admin access on arbitrary
  accounts. **Never re-add a body-shape branch to this route without an
  explicit `requireStaffRole("admin")` check of its own** — every access
  change belongs behind the same admin-rank gate.
- `POST/DELETE /api/admin/products/images` verify the caller's brand
  actually owns the target product (`canAccessFolder()`) before touching
  Storage — a brand owner could previously overwrite or delete another
  brand's images by guessing/knowing its product id. A brand-new product
  (no DB row yet, still using a client-generated temp folder id) is
  allowed through since there's nothing to check ownership against yet.
- `lib/csv.ts`'s `toCsv()` prefixes any cell starting with `=`/`+`/`-`/`@`
  with an apostrophe — CSV/Formula Injection mitigation, since order
  exports include customer-typed fields (shipping name/city) that get
  opened in Excel by admins. Don't remove this even if it looks like dead
  code — the exploit only surfaces once someone actually opens the file.
- `lib/discord.ts`'s webhook payload always sends
  `allowed_mentions: { parse: [] }` — embeds carry customer/applicant
  text verbatim (shipping name, brand application fields), so without
  this a value like "@everyone" would ping the whole Discord server.
- `lib/rateLimit.ts` — a plain in-memory limiter (per-instance, resets on
  cold start; not distributed) applied to the two public unauthenticated
  write routes: `/api/coupons/validate` (20/5min per IP) and
  `/api/join/apply` (5/hour per IP). Good enough for this project's size;
  revisit with Upstash/Redis only if it needs to hold across many
  serverless instances.
- `next.config.js` sets baseline security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options,
  X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, HSTS). The
  CSP's `script-src`/`style-src` intentionally still allow
  `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval` (Next.js hydration + dev HMR need them) —
  its real value is restricting which *external* origins can load at
  all, not a fully locked-down policy. Update the CSP's `img-src`/
  `font-src`/`connect-src` allowlists here if a new external host
  (images, fonts, APIs) is ever added elsewhere in the app.
- **Next.js 16 / React 19** — upgraded from 14.2.35 (which had several
  disclosed CVEs per `npm audit`). Every dynamic route/page now uses the
  async `params`/`searchParams` API, and `createSupabaseServerClient()`
  is itself `async` (awaits `cookies()`, which is a Promise as of Next
  15+) — any new Server Component or Route Handler must `await` both.
  `middleware.ts` is now `proxy.ts` (Next 16 renamed the convention;
  same `export async function proxy(...)` shape). `next lint` no longer
  exists — linting runs `eslint .` directly against `eslint.config.mjs`
  (flat config, built from `eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals`).
  **Local dev runs `next dev --webpack`, not the Turbopack default** —
  Turbopack's dev server hits an environment-specific native SWC binding
  crash on this machine (`_swc.getBindingsSync is not a function`) that
  does not reproduce in `next build` (which already uses Turbopack
  successfully, and is what Vercel actually runs) — keep `--webpack` on
  the `dev` script unless that's independently confirmed fixed upstream.
- `/brands/[slug]`'s ISR caching (lost right after the Next 16 upgrade,
  since `requireUser()`/`requireBrandOwner()` reading `cookies()`
  unconditionally opts the *whole* route out of static generation under
  Next 15+) is fixed: the Follow-button/owner-check now lives in
  `components/brand/BrandHeroActions.tsx`, a client island that fetches
  its own state from `GET /api/brands/[slug]/viewer-status` on mount,
  instead of the page resolving it server-side. `BrandHero` itself takes
  only `brand` as a prop now. **Any future per-viewer bit added to a
  static/ISR page should follow this same pattern** (a small client
  component + its own API route) rather than reading `cookies()` in the
  page component directly, which would silently make the whole route
  dynamic again.

## Current status (what's built vs. not)

**Done:**
- Full storefront: browsing, cart, wishlist, live search with autocomplete,
  working filters (brand/price/size/color/availability/rating) on
  `/shop/[category]`, mega menu, journal, error boundaries.
- **Supabase Auth** (customer accounts) + **real order persistence** —
  checkout writes through a server-side API route with the service_role
  key; `orders`/`order_items` are real, not just UI.
- **Admin dashboard** (`/admin`) — products, brands, orders, users,
  coupons, revenue analytics, homepage/journal CMS (`site_content`),
  audit log, notification bell.
- **Brand-owner portal** (`/brand-portal`) — `brand_owner`/`brand_assistant`
  roles (`brands.owner_user_id` / `brand_staff` table), own-brand product
  management, brand page content editor, stock/orders/logs views.
- **Full account dashboard** (`/account/*`) — Overview, Orders (status
  tabs), Wishlist (real per-account, not just localStorage), Addresses
  (full CRUD + checkout prefill), Settings (profile/password/delete),
  Notifications (preference toggles), Payment Methods (placeholder, no
  gateway yet), Recently Viewed, Followed Brands.
- Redesigned public brand pages (`/brands/[slug]`) — real Follow, stats
  band, Shop-the-Look, brand-scoped Best Sellers, a real product
  filter/sort (shared with `/shop/[category]` via `useProductFilters`).
- Role-gated cross-navigation: admin ↔ brand-portal ↔ account, each link
  only visible to accounts with the matching role/ownership.
- **Instant-Publish**: a brand owner/assistant's product
  create/edit/archive applies live immediately, with **no pre-approval
  gate** — the admin gets a resolvable notification (Approve/Revert,
  reusing `audit_logs.before_value`/`after_value` as the revert source)
  via the bell and `/admin/products/review` ("Brand Activity" feed).
  **Do not reintroduce a pending-review gate for brand-initiated product
  writes** — this replaced that model on purpose.
- **Discord log mirroring** — every `notify()`/`logAudit()` call, plus
  every pre-existing "log it, don't throw" error site, also posts a
  color-coded structured embed (green = added, orange = edited, red =
  removed) to one of 3 Discord webhook channels (`#notifications`,
  `#audit-log`, `#errors`) via `lib/discord.ts`/`lib/errorLog.ts`. The
  `notifications` table stays capped at the most recent 50 rows via a
  Postgres trigger (`prune_old_notifications`) — Discord is the permanent
  archive for anything older; `audit_logs` itself stays unbounded. Wiring
  a new write path into `notify()`/`logAudit()` gets Discord mirroring
  for free; no separate integration needed. Webhook URLs are optional
  env vars (`DISCORD_WEBHOOK_NOTIFICATIONS`/`_AUDIT_LOG`/`_ERRORS`) —
  everything no-ops silently if unset, never throws.

**Not done yet:**
1. **Payment gateway** — Paymob or Fawry (Egypt-first) or Stripe. Checkout
   UI and real order persistence already exist; no actual payment
   processing is wired in yet (orders are created without a live charge).

## Conventions to keep following

- Arabic/English mixed conversation history — code, comments, and commit
  messages are in English; explanations to the person are in Egyptian
  Arabic when that's the language they're using.
- Prefer editing the shared `lib/format.ts` / `components/shared/` over
  reintroducing per-component duplicates of price formatting or star
  ratings.
- Run `npm run build` locally before pushing — ESLint errors (like
  unescaped entities) fail production builds even when `next dev` looks fine.
